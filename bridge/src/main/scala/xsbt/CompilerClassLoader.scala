/**  A classloader to run the compiler
 *
 *   A CompilerClassLoader is constructed from a list of `urls` that need to be on
 *   the classpath to run the compiler and the classloader used by sbt.
 *
 *   To understand why a custom classloader is needed for the compiler, let us
 *   describe some alternatives that wouldn't work.
 *   - `new URLClassLoader(urls)`:
 *     The compiler contains sbt phases that callback to sbt using the `xsbti.*`
 *     interfaces. If `urls` does not contain the sbt interfaces we'll get a
 *     `ClassNotFoundException` in the compiler when we try to use them, if
 *     `urls` does contain the interfaces we'll get a `ClassCastException` or a
 *     `LinkageError` because if the same class is loaded by two different
 *     classloaders, they are considered distinct by the JVM.
 *    - `new URLClassLoader(urls, sbtLoader)`:
 *      Because of the JVM delegation model, this means that we will only load
 *      a class from `urls` if it's not present in the parent `sbtLoader`, but
 *      sbt uses its own version of the scala compiler and scala library which
 *      is not the one we need to run the compiler.
 *
 *  Our solution is to implement a subclass of URLClassLoader with no parent, instead
 *  we override `loadClass` to load the `xsbti.*` interfaces from `sbtLoader`.

  /** Fix the compiler bridge ClassLoader

   *  Soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imamcajBEJs
   *
   *  The classloader that we get from sbt looks like:
   *
   *    URLClassLoader(bridgeURLs,
   *      DualLoader(scalaLoader, notXsbtiFilter, sbtLoader, xsbtiFilter))
   *
   *  DualLoader will load the `xsbti.*` interfaces using `sbtLoader` and
   *  everything else with `scalaLoader`. Once we have loaded the dotty Main
   *  class using `scalaLoader`, subsequent classes in the dotty compiler will
   *  also be loaded by `scalaLoader` and _not_ by the DualLoader. But the sbt
   *  compiler phases are part of dotty and still need access to the `xsbti.*`
   *  interfaces in `sbtLoader`, therefore DualLoader does not work for us
   *  (this issue is not present with scalac because the sbt phases are
   *  currently defined in the compiler bridge itself, not in scalac).
   *
   *  CompilerClassLoader is a replacement for DualLoader. Until we can fix
   *  this in sbt proper, we need to use reflection to construct our own
   *  fixed classloader:
   *
   *    URLClassLoader(bridgeURLs,
   *      CompilerClassLoader(scalaLoader.getURLs, sbtLoader))
   *
   *  @param bridgeLoader  The classloader that sbt uses to load the compiler bridge
   *  @return A fixed classloader that works with dotty
